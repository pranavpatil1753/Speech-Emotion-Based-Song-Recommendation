# Speech-Emotion-Based-Song-Recommendation
Engineered an intelligent system that curates the perfect playlist by listening to the sound of your voice. This project
translates vocal tones into emotions—like happy, sad, or angry—using a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). By analyzing key audio features (MFCCs), our model recommends music that truly matches your mood in
real-time via a Flask API, achieving great emotion detection accuracy.
